FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page

This is the first of the Responsive Web Design Projects in Free Code Camp. The objective 
was to build a tribute page that meets Free Code Camp's user stories requirements.

For this project I only used HTML and plain CSS.

You can find the list of requirements as well as further information on this project 
[here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). 
You can view my completed projects on github and codepen by clicking [here](https://github.com/dianawallace/FCC-Tribute-Page).

Thank you!
