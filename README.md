FreeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page

This is the first of the Responsive Web Design Projects in Free Code Camp. The objective 
was to build a tribute page that meets Free Code Camp's user stories requirements.

For this project I only used HTML and plain CSS.

For my tribute I chose Baroque artist Caravaggio as he is one of my favorite artists 
with his realistic observations of people and dynamic lighting. 

You can find the list of requirements as well as further information on this project 
[here](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page). 
You can view my completed projects on github [here](https://github.com/dianawallace/FCC-Tribute-Page) and codepen

Thank you!
